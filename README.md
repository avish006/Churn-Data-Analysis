# Churn Data Analysis And Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in a Telco dataset. It covers data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, machine learning model training, and visualization using Power BI.

## Key Highlights

1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, outliers, and transformed categorical variables.

2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified churn patterns, correlations, and key customer trends.

3: Feature Engineering: Created new features and optimized existing ones to improve model performance.

4: Machine Learning Models: Trained, evaluated and ensembled XGBoost and LightGBM for churn prediction.

5: Power BI Visualization: Developed interactive dashboards to present key insights and trends.

## Dataset

Source: Telco Customer Churn Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

## Tech Stack

Programming & ML: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM

Visualization: Power BI

Data Storage: CSV files

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution of churned vs. non-churned customers

Impact of tenure, contract type, monthly charges, Payment methods and Types of services taken by the users on churn

Correlation between all other features and churn rate

## Model Training & Evaluation

Models Used: XGBoost, LightGBM and Logistic Regression (Meta-Model)

Metrics Evaluated: Accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC

Best Performing Model Metric: ROC-AUC: 84.5, F1-Score: 0.64, Accuracy: 75.6
